# LocalCryptoSwap White Paper

## Abstract
LocalCryptoSwap is a decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) cryptocurrency exchange platform built on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to securely and directly swap cryptocurrencies without the need for intermediaries. By leveraging smart contract technology and an escrow mechanism, LocalCryptoSwap ensures trustless and seamless transactions while maintaining user privacy and security.

## Introduction
Cryptocurrency trading has grown exponentially, but centralized exchanges dominate the market, introducing potential risks such as hacking, fraud, and censorship. LocalCryptoSwap aims to address these issues by providing a decentralized platform where users can trade cryptocurrencies directly, leveraging Ethereum smart contracts to ensure fairness and security.

Our mission is to democratize cryptocurrency trading by providing a user-friendly, decentralized, and secure marketplace for peer-to-peer exchanges. LocalCryptoSwap offers features like customizable trading offers, multi-token support, and an escrow system to protect both buyers and sellers.

---

## Problem Statement
Centralized exchanges pose several challenges, including:
- **Security Risks:** Centralized platforms are vulnerable to hacking and data breaches.
- **High Fees:** Transaction and withdrawal fees can be excessive.
- **Censorship:** Governments or centralized entities can restrict access.
- **Lack of Privacy:** User data and transaction history are often stored and exposed.

---

## Solution
LocalCryptoSwap addresses these challenges by offering a decentralized P2P exchange platform. Key features include:

1. **Trustless Transactions:** Ethereum smart contracts manage escrow and facilitate secure transactions without intermediaries.
2. **Escrow Mechanism:** Funds are held in escrow until both parties fulfill the trade conditions. Only USDT (ERC-20) and USDC (ERC-20) will be used for escrow when buying, selling, or swapping.
3. **Custom Offers:** Users can create and customize offers, including price, limits, and payment methods.
4. **Decentralized Architecture:** The platform does not hold user funds or data, reducing the risk of hacking.
5. **Multi-Token Support:** Trade a wide variety of Ethereum-based tokens (ERC-20) and potentially integrate Layer 2 solutions.

### 3. **Smart Contracts**
- **Escrow Contract:** Holds tokens securely during the transaction.

## Core Features

### 1. Buying and Selling Crypto
Users can directly buy or sell cryptocurrencies by posting or accepting offers. The platform supports various trading pairs, with prices set by the users.

### 2. Swapping Crypto
The P2P swapping feature enables users to exchange USDT or USDC for other cryptocurrencies directly. It incentivizes users who create liquidity-providing advertisements for less commonly traded tokens, fostering a diverse and active trading ecosystem.

### 3. Escrow Service
Funds are locked in a smart contract until the buyer confirms receipt of payment. If disputes arise, arbitration can be initiated.

### 4. Reputation System
Users build trust through a rating system based on completed trades. This helps identify reliable traders.

### 5. Fee Structure
- A small flat fee (e.g., 0.1%) is charged per trade.
- Fees are used to maintain the platform and incentivize development.

### 6. Privacy and Security
- No KYC requirements by the platform. P2P KYC is enabled
- End-to-end encryption for communication.
- Funds remain in users' wallets until a trade is executed.

## P2P KYC Verification
To address the risks associated with non-KYC trading and prevent potential fraudulent activities, LocalCryptoSwap introduces a P2P KYC verification feature. This system allows advertisers to verify users who wish to buy or sell cryptocurrencies. Each user will have a KYC count displayed on their profile, showing the number of times they have been successfully verified by advertisers. This KYC count will only be visible when a buy, sell, or swap is initiated. Additionally, the profile will list the advertisers who conducted these verifications, fostering transparency and trust.

Advertisers can set specific trade requirements, such as a minimum number of completed KYC verifications, before engaging in transactions. Alternatively, they may choose to allow trades without KYC at their discretion. The KYC verification process involves users uploading live images of identification documents, selfies, and/or handwritten notes, as requested by the advertiser. These images will be end-to-end encrypted and watermarked to prevent misuse. Importantly, the platform itself will have no access to view the uploaded images, ensuring user privacy.

This P2P KYC system aims to create a safer trading environment while maintaining flexibility for advertisers and users alike.
